# Notes
The main arguments of the essay must be updated in light of changes in understanding of the WAM and the AHP since 2016.
The focus will move away from a reinterpretation of evidence in light of updated mechanisms towards the presentation and criticial analysis of evidence for abrupt change.
## Proposed title
**What is the role of Oceans in abrupt change in the Sahel?**

## Plan
### Introduction
- Intro to Sahel
    - Level of development
    - Agricultural
    - Importance of WAM
- Late 20th century drought
- Importance of projecting future
    - Food/water security
    - Ocean fertilisation
    - Amazon fertilisation

### Historic WAM Variability
- Overview of recent trends
    - Baseline, drought
    - Recovery/ regreening
        - Decoupled land-surface/WAM
        - Spatially heterogenous
        - Changing rainfall regime  
- SST-WAM variability *statistics*
    - Tropical Indian, Pacific
    - Atlantic (Tropical, Pacific, cross-equatorial gradient) 
- SST-WAM variability *mechanics*
    - Traditional dynamics 
    - Traditional mechanics
    - New dynamics
    - New mechanics
    - Summarise old/traditional competition
- Non oceanic influences
    - Land-surface -- Atmosphere
        - Evapotranspiration
        - Albedo
        - Soil moisture
        - Aerosols
    - Direct (radiative) CO2 forcing
    - Evaluate importance
- GCMs to understand mechanisms and future 
    - CMIP 3, 5
    - Successes, issues, biases
        - Indirect vs Direct
        - Old vs New
    - Inadequacy of historic record in constraining projections
        - Change in dominant influence from tropical to extratropical

### Past WAM Variability
- Overview of wet/dry phases over several Ma
    - Long-term sedimentary records of dust
    - Gradual Milankovitch forcing
    - Glacial forcing
- Post-LGM
    - Non-dust evidence of AHP conditions
    - Dust evidence of abruptness
        - deglaciation, AHP onset, termination
        - YD, H1
    - Issues of sedimentation as climate proxy (decoupling)
        - Wind
        - Hotspots, vegetation feedback
        - Dust generation: arid > hyperarid
        - Ocean currents
    - Non-dust evidence of abrupt change
    - Conflicting/heterogenous/time-transgressive termination
- Mechanisms of abrupt change
    - Relation to current decadal controls
    - Glacial reorganisation
        - Shutoff of NADW formation
        - Global SSTs
        - Land surface feedbacks
        - Evidence (and issues) for abrupt forcing
- GCMs
    - Overview of findings, successes
    - Ocean vs land surface
    - Issues
    - Improvements
        - Use of historic to understand mechanisms
        - Scope for re-interpretation (post-Nicholson)

### Conclusion
- Reiterate importance of projecting WAM
- Summarise schools of thought
- How understanding of past aids future projections
- Acknowledgement of complexity
    - Role of feedbacks
    - Spatial/temporal heterogeneity in mechanisms and response
- Outstanding issues

## Notes and things to remember
- Be very explicit with regards to physics (mechanisms, GCMs) and chemistry (proxy data)
- Be critical of evidence, models, assumptions
